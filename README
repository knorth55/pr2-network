Describes Setup and uses of PR2 internal Network.

The upgrade to Indigo removes the CTR350 AP to use the on-board on C1 Intel 7260 wireless card in AP mode.
Hostapd is used to create the AP.  The AP (wlan0) is bridged with lan0 to be br0.
The DHCP server listens on br0 for requests.
Bridging the interface allows for seamless transition between wired and wireless using the DNS service provided by DNSMASQ.
